# GANs model
* Generate Random Data
* Generative newtwork generate fake data
* Discirminative network try to find the fake data
* Update the weights of both models then restart
the problem of generating a new image of dog is equivalent to the problem of generating a new vector following the “dog probability distribution” over the N dimensional vector space.
